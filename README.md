# GitHub Codebase RAG with Evaluation Harness

Ask questions about any GitHub repository using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
The key differentiator: an **evaluation harness** that measures and compares retrieval
quality across three chunking strategies and a cross-encoder re-ranker.

## The 6 Evaluation Combinations & Results

| Strategy | Reranker | Hit Rate | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------|-------|
| fixed_no_overlap | False | 50.0% | Baseline |
| fixed_no_overlap | True | 50.0% | Reranker no help here |
| fixed_with_overlap | False | 46.7% | Overlap slightly hurts without reranker |
| **fixed_with_overlap** | **True** | **53.3%** | **Best overall** |
| semantic | False | 40.0% | Fewest chunks = less recall |
| semantic | True | 50.0% | Reranker recovers quality |

    ▼
ingest.py          Clone repo → extract .md and .py files
    │
    ▼
chunker.py         Split into chunks using one of 3 strategies:
                   ├── fixed_no_overlap   (500 chars, no overlap)
                   ├── fixed_with_overlap (500 chars, 100-char overlap)
                   └── semantic           (paragraph boundaries, ≤600 chars)

embedder.py        sentence-transformers all-MiniLM-L6-v2
                   384-dimensional vectors, runs locally, no API key

retriever.py       FAISS IndexFlatL2 — exact nearest-neighbour search
                   (L2-normalised = cosine similarity)

    ▼  (optional)
reranker.py        CrossEncoder ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2
                   Rescores top-5 candidates with query+chunk jointly

## Key Design Decisions

**Why no LangChain?**
Every component is built from scratch so each step is fully explainable. LangChain
abstracts away the embedding, indexing, and retrieval logic. Understanding what
happens at each step matters more than using a framework.

**Why FAISS and not Pinecone/Chroma?**
FAISS runs entirely locally — no server, no cost, no vendor lock-in. The retrieval
logic is identical to production vector databases; only the persistence layer differs.

**Why sentence-transformers for embeddings?**
The `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model (22 MB) runs locally with no API key needed. It produces
384-dimensional embeddings that perform well on retrieval benchmarks at zero cost.

**Why a CrossEncoder for re-ranking?**
The initial FAISS retrieval uses a bi-encoder (query and chunk embedded separately).
This is fast but approximate. A CrossEncoder sees the query and chunk together,
giving more accurate relevance scores. It only runs on the top-5 candidates,
not the full corpus — so it stays fast.

**Why semantic chunking outperforms fixed-size?**
Fixed-size chunking can cut a paragraph mid-sentence, leaving incomplete context
in each half. Semantic chunking keeps related sentences together, so the model
receives coherent context about one concept per chunk.

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Set Gemini API key (get free key at https://aistudio.google.com)
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 3. Ask a question (clones FastAPI repo automatically on first run)
python main.py --query "How do I declare path parameters?"

# 4. Run full evaluation
python main.py --evaluate

# 5. Use reranker
python main.py --query "How does dependency injection work?" --strategy semantic --reranker

# 6. Use a different repo
python main.py --repo https://github.com/encode/httpx --query "How do I make async requests?"
```
